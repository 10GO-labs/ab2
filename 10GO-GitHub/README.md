# 10GO-GitHub

10GO-GitHub is an innovative solution designed to prove builder status through contributions to a GitHub repository without revealing the user's identity, enabling anonymous claims of airdrops. Our project leverages Aztec's programmable cryptography to ensure a seamless, secure, and privacy-focused process for builders to claim rewards without compromising their GitHub username. We use zkEmail to create verifiable, privacy-preserving proofs of user contributions.

This project has the potential to empower builders in the Web3 space by providing a transparent yet private way to verify their work and claim rewards, fostering a more inclusive environment for developers who value their anonymity.

We are a team based in Argentina with 2-3 years of experience in Web3. Our journey began as ZK enthusiasts participating in the PSE Core Program in Buenos Aires 2024, where we learned about Aztec. Fascinated by the potential of programmable cryptography, we are eager to build real-world applications that leverage Aztec's capabilities in private transactions and smart contracts.

Our collective experience includes working with zkDSLs like Circom and Noir, which has prepared us to dive deeper into zero-knowledge technologies. We've collaborated on several blockchain and privacy-focused projects, such as [OpenFlow](https://github.com/openflow-labs/openflow), [ZKam](https://github.com/zkam-labs/zkam), and [10GO](https://github.com/10GO-labs/10GO).

We've also actively participated in hackathons, winning first prize in the ZK/Privacy track at the Ethereum Argentina Level Up Hackathon with our project ZKam. Additionally, we secured first place in the Filecoin Foundation, ZKSync, and Protocol Labs tracks at the Aleph Ciudad de Crecimiento Hackathon with our project OpenFlow, and were runners-up in the Polygon track.

As an independent team, we're excited to contribute our skills and passion to the Aztec ecosystem and look forward to the opportunity to make a meaningful impact.
